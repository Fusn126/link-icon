## Link Icons

Provides link icons for themes that do not have built-in link icons (such as cliff-dark, toy).

Thanks to [Achuan-2 Tsundoku Theme](https://github.com/Achuan-2/siyuan-themes-tsundoku) for providing 148 icons.

Supports displaying page icons when referencing pages, thanks to the code provided by [mdzz2048](https://github.com/chenshinshi/link-icon/issues/1).
